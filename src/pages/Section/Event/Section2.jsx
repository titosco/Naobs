            Exams? Done. Deadlines? Gone. Now it's time to breathe, dance, and just be. Bricks, Rhythm & Chills is back, and if you know, you know. This isn't just another event, it's the Building Department link-up. The kind that brings everyone out â€” faces you haven't seen all semester, songs that hit different, and vibes that make you forget all the stress. It's our rhythm. Our vibe. Don't dull.
